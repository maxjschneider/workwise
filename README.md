# WorkWise



## Product Vision 

WorkWise seeks to provide an all-encompassing software solution to workplace management. We aim to be the go-to platform for any business seeking a comprehensive, user-friendly, and efficient tool to manage their workplace. 

Our primary focus is on employee scheduling. Businesses desire an intuitive and dynamic system that adapts to their needs, and is easy to use for both the employer and the employee, and that is what we intend to deliver.

Beyond just scheduling, WorkWise will also be designed to handle taxes, employee files, shift approvals, time-off requests, and much more.
